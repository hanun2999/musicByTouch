# musicByTouch
This is a virtual instrument simulator that uses the Leap Motion sensor to track finger and hand movements. musicByTouch currently supports bongos, a guitar, and a trumpet. A user is able to play these instruments by emulating the same hand movements as they would with real instruments. The instruments are created and visualized in a 3D space using Unity and the Leap Motion Assets.
